# FindFoxesGame
simple game, made with SFML ("yeap, I wrote "founded" instead of "found")
it is coursework, so, I didn't choose the rules
you have to find all foxes
to find a fox you need to click the cell, where fox/foxes are hiding
the game gives you amount of foxes, located on the same horizontal \ vertical \ diagonal line with you
due to rules, it is impossible to lose ))
